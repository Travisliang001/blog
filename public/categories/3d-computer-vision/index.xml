      <description>Abstract In this report, we present a novel approach for 3D medical image segmentation using point clouds. 3D Convolutional Neural Networks have been the most dominating networks in medical image processing but they require large memory footprints and training samples. Hence we used point clouds to represent the image instead of voxels. Point clouds are lightweight and contain shape and smoother surface information. We extracted the point clouds from 3D voxel images using canny edge detection.</description>
